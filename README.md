Some interests or activities require more than one person to do them, and sometimes finding other people who want to do the same activity is hard.  We aim to solve this problem by providing a way to locate others in the area with the same interest or activity.  This app would be unique because it will be cross-platform, and we will help create ways to manage groups of people with the same interest, which is different from our main competitor, InCommon, that only helps people find a friend who has more than one common interest with the other person in question.
